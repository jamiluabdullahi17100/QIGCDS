## Technical Implementation

### Diplomacy Engine
```python
class DiplomaticSimulation:
    def __init__(self):
        self.negotiation_system = NegotiationEngine()
        self.cultural_analyzer = CulturalAnalysis()
        self.quantum_predictor = QuantumOutcomePredictor()
        
    def simulate_negotiation(self, parties):
        # Multi-party negotiation simulation
        pass
        
    def analyze_treaty_stability(self, agreement):
        # Treaty stability analysis
        pass
```

### Analysis Framework

## Usage Guide

### Negotiation Simulation
```python
# Initialize diplomatic scenario
simulation = DiplomaticSimulation(
    civilizations=["Alpha Centauri", "Sirius Prime", "Vega Alliance"],
    cultural_factors=True,
    quantum_prediction=True
)

# Run negotiation simulation
results = simulation.simulate_negotiation(
    objective="Peace Treaty",
    constraints={"resource_sharing": True, "technology_exchange": False}
)
```

### Treaty Analysis
```python
# Analyze treaty stability
analyzer = TreatyAnalyzer(
    parties=3,
    time_horizon="100 years",
    stability_threshold=0.85
)

# Generate stability prediction
stability = analyzer.predict_treaty_stability()
```
